Class patches : 
This code defines a custom TensorFlow Layer called Patches, designed to split input images into smaller, non-overlapping patches. This layer is often used in computer vision tasks and transformer models, where image patches are treated like "tokens" in the same way that words or characters are tokens in text processing.

Here's a breakdown of the purpose and functionality:

Class Initialization (__init__):
The Patches class inherits from tf.keras.layers.Layer, which allows it to function like a layer in a neural network. The patch_size parameter is defined, specifying the height and width of each square patch extracted from the input images.

Patch Extraction (call method):

The call method defines what the layer does when it is applied to input data (images).
tf.image.extract_patches is used to divide each image into patches. The sizes, strides, and rates arguments in this function specify that:
Each patch will be patch_size x patch_size pixels in dimension.
Patches are non-overlapping, as the stride is set to the patch size.
After extraction, each image in the batch is split into multiple patches, which are then flattened along the last dimension.
The reshaping at the end produces a tensor of shape [batch_size, num_patches, patch_dims], where num_patches is the number of patches per image and patch_dims is the number of values in each patch (i.e., patch_size * patch_size * num_channels).
Configuration Storage (get_config method):

The get_config method returns a dictionary of the layer's configuration, which allows the layer to be saved and reloaded with its settings intact.
By including patch_size in the config, the layer's functionality can be preserved if the model is saved and reloaded.
Why Use This Layer?
This Patches layer is particularly useful in Vision Transformer (ViT) models, which require images to be divided into patches before feeding them into the transformer architecture. Rather than treating the image as a whole, transformers process each patch as a separate token, allowing for more fine-grained attention across different regions of the image.

def mlp :

This code defines an mlp (multi-layer perceptron) function, which is a simple feedforward neural network. The purpose of this function is to apply multiple dense (fully connected) layers with a specified activation function and dropout for regularization. Here’s a breakdown of the function and its purpose:

Function Parameters:

x: The input tensor to the MLP.
hidden_units: A list specifying the number of units (or neurons) in each hidden layer.
dropout_rate: The dropout rate applied after each dense layer for regularization.
Layer-by-Layer Processing:

The function loops through each number in hidden_units, where each number represents the number of units in a hidden layer.
For each layer:
A Dense layer is applied with units neurons and the gelu (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) activation function, which is often used in transformer models and works particularly well in deep networks.
A Dropout layer is applied immediately after each dense layer with a specified dropout_rate, which helps prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the output units to zero during training.
Returning the Output:

After the loop, the output x represents the processed tensor after going through the MLP layers.
Purpose of the mlp Function
This function is commonly used in transformer-based models and other deep learning architectures that incorporate a multi-layer perceptron block. The MLP block serves as a lightweight fully-connected network component that adds non-linearity and learns complex patterns in the data. The dropout regularization helps prevent overfitting, improving the model’s generalization to new data.

followed one : This code is intended to demonstrate the process of splitting an image into patches, resizing it, and visualizing the patches. This is useful in models like Vision Transformers (ViTs), where images are divided into smaller segments, or "patches," which are then processed individually.

Here's a breakdown of the code and its purpose:

Displaying a Random Image:

image = x_train[np.random.choice(range(x_train.shape[0]))]: This line selects a random image from the training dataset x_train.
plt.imshow(image.astype("uint8")): Displays the selected image. astype("uint8") converts the image to an 8-bit integer format, which is typical for images.
plt.axis("off"): Hides the axes for a cleaner visualization.
Resizing the Image:

resized_image = ops.image.resize(...): This line resizes the image to image_size x image_size pixels using ops.image.resize.
ops.convert_to_tensor([image]): Converts the image into a tensor format compatible with TensorFlow/Keras.
Creating Image Patches:

patches = Patches(patch_size)(resized_image): This line uses the previously defined Patches layer to divide the resized image into smaller patches, each of size patch_size x patch_size. The Patches layer returns a tensor with each patch flattened.
print(...): Prints the dimensions of the image, patch size, number of patches per image, and elements (pixels) per patch for reference.
Visualizing Patches:

n = int(np.sqrt(patches.shape[1])): This calculates the number of patches along each dimension (e.g., if the image is divided into 16 patches, n would be 4).
The for loop iterates over each patch and reshapes it back to its original dimensions (patch_size, patch_size, 3) for display.
Each patch is visualized in a grid using plt.subplot(n, n, i + 1).
Summary of the Code's Purpose
This code visually demonstrates the process of splitting an image into patches, which is often used in transformer models. By displaying the individual patches, it provides a clear understanding of how an image is tokenized into smaller parts. The patching process allows transformers to process and analyze distinct regions of an image separately, supporting tasks like image classification or object detection.
==================================================
class patchencoder : and belows function call :

These two code snippets work together to build a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification. The PatchEncoder class and the create_vit_classifier function work in sequence: PatchEncoder encodes image patches, and create_vit_classifier builds the entire Vision Transformer model, using the encoded patches as input.

Code 1: PatchEncoder Layer
The PatchEncoder class is a custom Keras layer that encodes the patches of an image by projecting them to a higher-dimensional space and adding positional embeddings. Here's a breakdown:

Initialization (__init__):

num_patches: Total number of patches in the image.
projection_dim: Dimension for the projection of each patch.
self.projection: Dense layer that projects each patch to the specified dimension.
self.position_embedding: Embedding layer to create positional embeddings, indicating the relative position of each patch in the image.
Forward Pass (call):

positions: Creates a sequence of indices representing patch positions.
encoded: Projects each patch using self.projection and adds positional embeddings from self.position_embedding.
Configuration Saving (get_config):

This method enables saving and loading the layer with its parameters, making it compatible with the Keras model serialization format.
The PatchEncoder is responsible for encoding each image patch into a higher-dimensional, position-aware representation. This allows the transformer layers to interpret patch order and spatial arrangement within the image.

Code 2: create_vit_classifier Function
The create_vit_classifier function builds the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification. It processes images in patches, encodes them, and applies multiple transformer blocks before outputting classification logits.

Input and Data Augmentation:

Takes an image input tensor and applies data augmentation to it.
Patch Creation and Encoding:

Converts the augmented image into patches using the Patches layer.
Passes patches to PatchEncoder to generate encoded patches with positional awareness.
Transformer Blocks:

Each transformer block applies:
Layer Normalization: Stabilizes training by normalizing inputs.
Multi-Head Attention: Performs self-attention on the encoded patches.
Skip Connection: Adds the input back to the attention output to preserve original information.
MLP: Adds a multi-layer perceptron for additional learning.
Skip Connection: Adds another skip connection after the MLP.
These blocks process the encoded patches, allowing the model to learn dependencies between patches.
Classification Head:

Normalizes and flattens the final encoded patches.
Applies dropout to prevent overfitting.
Passes the representation through another MLP and a final dense layer to output logits for classification.
Model Creation:

Defines the entire process as a Keras model and returns it.
Relationship and Summary
The PatchEncoder and create_vit_classifier work in sequence within a Vision Transformer architecture:

PatchEncoder encodes patches with position information, making them suitable for transformer processing.
create_vit_classifier uses this encoding to build the Vision Transformer model, applying self-attention and MLP blocks on the encoded patches and outputting classification predictions.
Summary: The PatchEncoder transforms image patches into position-aware vectors, and create_vit_classifier builds a Vision Transformer model using these encoded patches to classify images by analyzing spatial relationships within patches. This architecture leverages transformer blocks, enabling it to learn complex patterns and interactions between image regions.

last before 2 codes:
Code 1: run_experiment Function with plot_history Function
In this code:

Optimizer: The AdamW optimizer is used to compile the model, with learning_rate and weight decay parameters. AdamW is often preferred for its weight decay, which helps prevent overfitting.
Model Compilation: The model is compiled with SparseCategoricalCrossentropy for multi-class classification and evaluation metrics like SparseCategoricalAccuracy and SparseTopKCategoricalAccuracy.
Checkpointing: A ModelCheckpoint callback saves the best model based on validation accuracy.
Training: The model is trained on x_train and y_train data with a validation split of 0.1, and the training history is returned.
Model Evaluation: The model loads the best weights and evaluates its performance on x_test and y_test.
Plotting: The plot_history function plots training and validation loss and top-5 accuracy over epochs using the history from training.
Code 2: Direct Plotting of Training History
In this code:

Manually Created history Dictionary: Instead of obtaining the history from a model, the history dictionary directly contains sample data for accuracy, val_accuracy, loss, and val_loss across epochs.
Plotting: Two subplots show training vs. validation accuracy and training vs. validation loss over epochs using matplotlib.
Relationship Between Code 1 and Code 2
Both codes plot model training history, showing how accuracy and loss evolve over epochs. Code 1 obtains history directly from the model training process and plots it with a helper function (plot_history). Code 2, however, uses a pre-defined dictionary to simulate the history and directly plots the metrics without calling any model functions.

In summary:

Code 1 shows a complete training workflow, including model compilation, training, evaluation, and saving.
Code 2 replicates the plotting functionality without training a model, using a mock history dictionary to visualize accuracy and loss trends.

final code : This script loads a Vision Transformer (ViT) model and uses it to classify images within a directory. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the code and its functionality:

Step-by-Step Explanation:
Custom Layers:

Patches Layer: This layer divides input images into patches. Each patch has a defined size (patch_size) and is extracted using TensorFlow's extract_patches function, reshaping the patches to feed into the ViT model.
PatchEncoder Layer: This layer encodes patches with positional embeddings and a dense layer projection. It helps the model understand the order of patches, which is essential for learning spatial relationships.
Custom Deserialization:

custom_objects function: This function is used to load the model by mapping custom layers (Patches and PatchEncoder) to the model structure during deserialization. When the model is loaded, this function tells Keras how to interpret these custom layers.
Load the Model:

The saved ViT model (vit_model.keras) is loaded using load_model, with custom_objects provided to recognize custom layers.
Image Preprocessing:

prepare_image function: Given an image path, this function loads the image, resizes it to the required patch_size, and scales pixel values between 0 and 1. The image is reshaped to match the model’s input dimensions for prediction.
Batch Prediction from a Directory:

predict_directory function: This function iterates through all .jpg files in a specified directory. For each image:
It is preprocessed using prepare_image.
A prediction is made with the ViT model.
The predicted class is stored as an integer corresponding to a label index.
Mapping Class Indices to Labels:

class_indices: This assumes train_generator.class_indices was previously defined (likely from the training dataset) and contains the mappings from label indices to actual class names.
A dictionary class_labels is created, where each integer index is mapped to its class name, allowing for human-readable output.
Display Results:

Each image’s predicted class is displayed along with the image itself. The plt.imshow function loads the original resolution of the image, and plt.title shows the predicted class name.
Usage:
Set Directory Path: Specify the path to a folder containing .jpg test images in test_images_directory.
Set Patch Size: Ensure patch_size matches the expected input size used during the model’s training.
Run Predictions: The script will display each image with its predicted label.
This setup is tailored to Vision Transformer-based models that work with patch-based image input and positional encoding.
